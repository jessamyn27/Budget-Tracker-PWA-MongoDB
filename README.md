## Acceptance Criteria
```
GIVEN a user is on Budget App without an internet connection
WHEN the user inputs a withdrawal or deposit
THEN that will be shown on the page, and added to their transaction history when their connection is back online.

Offline Functionality:

  * Enter deposits offline

  * Enter expenses offline

When brought back online:

  * Offline entries should be added to tracker.
```

## User Story

* AS AN avid traveller
* I WANT to be able to track my withdrawals and deposits with or without a data/internet connection
* SO THAT my account balance is accurate when I am traveling

## Business Context

* Giving users a fast and easy way to track their money is important, but allowing them to access that information anytime is even more important. Having offline functionality is paramount to our applications success.
